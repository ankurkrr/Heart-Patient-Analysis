# End-to-End Heart Patient Classification Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease risk using machine learning models. The analysis covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection to build an accurate classifier. The notebook walks through the entire pipeline, from initial data exploration to final model evaluation.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
- Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for classification.
- Compare different algorithms to select the best-performing model.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, scaled features, and performed feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized key patterns and correlations in the dataset.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) and evaluated them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model Tuning:** Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the selected model.

## Tech Stack
- **Python:** Core language for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas, NumPy:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for model building and evaluation.
